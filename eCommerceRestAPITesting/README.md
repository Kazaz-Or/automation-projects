The scope of this project was REST API automation testing.

I used a local Wordpress website (ecommerce shop) that ran locally on my machine using MAMP and wooCommerce.
I used a local Database (MySQL) while using Local and MySQL Workbench.

The package runs in a docker.

I used pytest (and pytest html report for a detailed test report).

You can also find a detailed csv file with the list of tests (you can call it a test plan), and some SQL queries i ran manually to test my database before implmenting it as part of the code.
